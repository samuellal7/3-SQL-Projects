## 📖 Project Context  

To answer key business questions from various departments, this project involves querying and analyzing Rockbuster Stealth’s data using **SQL** (Structured Query Language).  

Throughout this project, SQL is learned and applied incrementally to solve increasingly complex business problems. The analysis results are presented to Rockbuster’s management team through clear visualizations, ensuring actionable insights that support strategic decision-making.  

Although this project focuses on the **online video streaming industry**, the SQL skills developed are **industry-agnostic** and demonstrate the ability to solve real-world data problems for a variety of clients.  

By the end of the project, you will be able to:  
- Perform various **query-based analyses** using SQL.  
- **Visualize and communicate insights** to both business and technical audiences.  
- Deliver a **portfolio-ready project** showcasing your technical and analytical expertise.
